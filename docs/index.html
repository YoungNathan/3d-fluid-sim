<h1 align="middle">3D Fluid Simulation</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">Abhi Anand, Jonathan Li, Nathan Young</h2>

    <div class="padded">
        <p>Our project will simulate fluid motion and interaction. Given time, we also wish to add some extra features such as demonstrating the pressure our fluid exerts on an object or comparing the results of different viscosities in our fluid.
</p>
    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
          We will use OpenGL to simulate our project, which we will have to learn from scratch. In attempting to simulate fluid motion, we must simplify the issue to hydrodynamic particle interactions. Our algorithm will be based on Miles Macklin’s and Matthias Muller’s Position Based Fluids paper. Understanding fluid dynamics is a challenging topic for this project but is necessary in mapping out particle interaction. Fluid simulation is significant in gaming for realistic visual effects and in problem solving for safe and efficient analysis.
        </p>
    <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <p>
          We desire to showcase a simulation that follows as closely as it can to reality. However, setting the exact fluid positions and environment for interactions to compare our simulation with real life isn’t practical. Our current idea is to compare our simulation with proven online versions to see if the results are the same and validate our interactions by using real-world examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal state is to be able to simulate the forces for particle collision in a manner replicative of water. We want to deliver a clip that shows the rendering of water being dropped into a mesh. We want the interaction between the water hitting the surface and water particles colliding with one another to be as realistic as possible. Furthermore, we will provide renderings of fluids with different viscosities (e.g. honey, oil, and water), to demonstrate that our particles are acting consistently with the physical limitations of the liquid substrate used in the process. To have a successful project, we hope to be able to render and demonstrate a working model of fluids interacting with a box-like structure. We wish to test our animations by first timing how long the fluid(s) take(s) to settle and compare them to another simulation found <a href="http://www.escapemotions.com/experiments/fluid_water_3/">here</a>. Our goal is to have comparable rates to this website, though we aren’t sure how feasible this is. Another way we hope to test our work is by comparing our renderings of different fluids to clips of those fluids being poured in the real world. If our interactions look similar (defined by how particle-surface and particle-particle collisions appear), then I believe we have succeeded in our task.

        </p>
        <p>
        Other than our main fluid simulation, we wish to add extra features that give us useful information about our fluid rather than just observe the fluid in motion. For example, the changes in the fluid pressure on an object or the changes in fluid motion as we change viscosity are two such features we wish to implement. We will also try to model the interaction between two different fluids (e.g. water and oil). Another stretch goal we have for the project is to use various materials for the structure that the fluid is dropped into. An example of this could be comparing a metal box with one made of a paper-towel like texture. This latter goal does seem more complicated as this requires a better understanding of how fluid textures interact with semi-permeable materials. These goals would give our project more realistic application points as well as give us a more encompassing understanding of fluid nature.

    <h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
<ul>

    <li>
      <b>Week 1:</b>
      Familiarize ourselves with OpenGL and other C++ libraries, understand the paper, and begin setting up meshes & particles as necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Week 2:</b>
      Implement forces that act on our particles & mesh like gravity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Week 3:</b>
      Implement particle to particle collisions and particle to surface collisions. Work on the application of viscosity to the particles. Potentially look into modifying viscosity based on particle type.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Week 4:</b>
      Render the particles to fluids and add any extra features. Obtain the clips necessary for the final website.
    </li>
</ul>
    <h2 align="middle"> Resources </h2>
    <p>
      The resources we’ve selected for the project are centered around bettering our understanding of what we need to implement and the baseline software we need to understand to translate the algorithms into usable code.
